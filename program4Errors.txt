In Circle.java

In the Scale(double Factor) method
The line: radius = radius + factor; does not scale the radius by the factor correctly
The test case in Circle1Test.java "simpleScalingPositive()" found this error
I Changed the line from:
radius = radius + factor;
to
radius = radius * factor;
So it can scale the radius correctly

In moveBY(double xOffset, double yOffset)
The line: center.y = center.y + xOffset; does not change the y coordinate correctly
The test case in Circle1Test.java "simpleMove()" found this error
I changed the line from:
center.y = center.y + xOffset;
to
center.y = center.y + yOffset;
so it can change the y coordinate correctly

In Circle1.java
In intersects(Circle other)
The code:
   if (Math.abs(center.x - other.center.x) < radius &&
       Math.abs(center.y - other.center.y) < radius)
does not have the correct alogrithm to calculate if the circles are intersecting eachother.
I cange the code from:
   if (Math.abs(center.x - other.center.x) < radius &&
       Math.abs(center.y - other.center.y) < radius)
to
if (Math.hypot(center.x - other.center.x, center.y - other.center.y) <= (radius + other.radius))
so it can correctly calculate if the circles are intersecting.

In Circle2.java

In Circle2(double x, double y, double radius)
The line: super(y,x,radius); does not correctly create the circle since the parameter y is going into the circle custuctor x and vise versa
I changed the line from:
super(y,x,radius);
to
super(x,y,radius);
so it can correctly constuct the circle
